# White Blood Cells Segmentation (Udacity Machine Learning Capstone)

## Project Overview
Developed an efficient Deep Learning model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to accurately demarcate the boundary of white blood cells in microscopic images of blood
- Technologies used : Tensorflow, Keras, AWS

File Structure:

* The data set is present in SigTuple_data folder. Training data is in SigTuple_data/Train_Data, after modified extra large images in train data, the new data files set is stored in SigTuple_data/New_Train_Data, Test data is in SigTuple_data/Test_Data and predicted masks for test data is in Submission_Data folder.
* All the parameters including epochs, img dimensions and extra parameters are all stored in all_params file
* Model is stored in model file
* All the preprocessing and training and predicting masks are done using Jupyter notebook named wbc_segmentation.ipynb
* capstone_project_report file describes the project architecture and implementation details
* wbc_segmentation.pdf and .html files for representation purpose for jupyter notebook

Please see the Jupyter notebook for complete running of the project.
